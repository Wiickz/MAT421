        "A linear space can be defined as a set of vectors whose elements can be multiplied by scalars and/or added together to create a result vector that also exists within the same set. Linear spaces have linear subspaces that exist under similar conditions: as a subset of a linear space, all multiplication/addition operations on the comprising vectors result in vectors that exist within the subset (and thus the set).\n",

        "As an example, suppose we have a linear space consisting of vectors [x, y, z]. Multiplying one of these vectors, or adding two (or three) of them together, results in a value that still depends entirely on the basis vectors (e.g. 2y or x+z). A subspace can be created consisting of only one or two of the basis vectors (e.g. [x, z]) that still follows the same rules (with multiplication or addition operations still creating results such as 4z+x).\n",
