        "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are differential equations with only one independent value (as an example, the function *y = f(x)*). These differential equations create simpler scenarios, but are still capable of modeling various real-world phenomena such as projectile motion. When solving ODEs, it's common that the first result is a function *g(x)* that still contains unknown variables/coefficients - known as a general solution - and in order to solve for those missing values and find a/the particular solution, a set of initial conditions is typically provided, which is just enough info to solve for the particular equation(s)."
